25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
<font color="#fcfcfc">You can put the path to your workbook</font>

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
<font color="#fcfcfc">For example</font>

27
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
<font color="#b4b4b4">The workbook is directly in my default path</font>

28
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400
<font color="#999999">But I can just call it by its name</font>

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760

94
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
<font color="#f8f8f8">But how can we prove that</font>

95
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
<font color="#f9f9f9">Well we can</font>

96
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,184

142
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
