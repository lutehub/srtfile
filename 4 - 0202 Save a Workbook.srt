<font color="#f1f1f1">Hello everyone and welcome back to our open pie Excel course</font>

2
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,056
<font color="#9e9e9e">And a sweatshirt we're going to learn how to save a workbook that we just</font>

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:20,480
<font color="#f5f5f5">In order to save a workbook we're going to first of all call the workbook B name w b</font>

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,576
<font color="#fbfbfb">And then we're going to call the save function</font>

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
<font color="#f4f4f4">On the workbook</font>

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
<font color="#a5a5a5">We're going to call</font>

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,792
<font color="#e8e8e8">And inside of the parentheses we're going to put in the argument</font>

8
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
<font color="#e3e3e3">4</font>

9
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
<font color="#e7e7e7">This save function</font>

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
<font color="#f9f9f9">And that argument is going to be the path</font>

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
<font color="#bdbdbd">To defile</font>

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
<font color="#f9f9f9">Do you want to save</font>

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,616
<font color="#8e8e8e">For example if I'm going to save it in the default location on my computer then all I have to do is put in the name of the file</font>

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,248
<font color="#e9e9e9">The name of my file is destination file name because that's the new workbook I created</font>

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
<font color="#ededed">And I stored that name in this variable destination file name</font>

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,928
<font color="#d1d1d1">So I can copy that variable destination file name and paste it into</font>

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
<font color="#f1f1f1">Be safe</font>

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
<font color="#fcfcfc">Function</font>

19
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
<font color="#efefef">This is going to save</font>

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="#f5f5f5">This file</font>

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
<font color="#bababa">It's new file to</font>

22
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,144
<font color="#fcfcfc">My default location</font>

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,800
<font color="#dbdbdb">Now if I want to save to a different location I have to put in the past before the founding</font>

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
<font color="#fcfcfc">For example suppose I want to save</font>

25
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,456
<font color="#eeeeee">This workbook not to my computer but to Google Drive</font>

26
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,576
<font color="#d6d6d6">What I can do is put in a path to Google Drive and then add the file name afterwards</font>

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,208
<font color="#a2a2a2">Tactical Drive is Flash content / g-drive / my dry</font>

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,816
<font color="#f3f3f3">And you just have to make sure you also add in a slash at the end</font>

29
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
<font color="#fcfcfc">Because this is the path to the file</font>

30
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
<font color="#d8d8d8">And then you also must add in the file name</font>

31
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
<font color="#f6f6f6">Otherwise the state function won't know</font>

32
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
<font color="#fcfcfc">How you want to save this file</font>

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
<font color="#a0a0a0">It's brand new file</font>

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
<font color="#b7b7b7">Everytime I run the code cell</font>

35
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,224
<font color="#dedede">This code is going to create a brand-new file</font>

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
<font color="#b6b6b6">What the same name is it going to override the previous house was going to delete the old file if there is a file</font>

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
<font color="#f8f8f8">Of this name is going to</font>

38
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
<font color="#fcfcfc">Make a new</font>

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
<font color="#fcfcfc">File</font>

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
<font color="#fcfcfc">On top of that instead</font>

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,096
<font color="#e0e0e0">And the file is always going to be called new underscore workbook</font>

42
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
<font color="#b0b0b0">Got xlsx</font>

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
<font color="#fcfcfc">Because that's what we called it</font>

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
<font color="#fcfcfc">In this project</font>

45
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,872
<font color="#f1f1f1">Now let's test this out if I want to see my file on Google Drive</font>

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
<font color="#c5c5c5">Because this is not my</font>

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,248
<font color="#bcbcbc">And not attack on my computer it's a pathan Google drive and I'm using Google</font>

48
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
<font color="#e5e5e5">Collab</font>

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,856
<font color="#fcfcfc">I have to import Google drive from Google colab</font>

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
<font color="#fbfbfb">If you're following along with Google colab</font>

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
<font color="#c2c2c2">And you want to stagedoor drive you also have to do that</font>

00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
<font color="#acacac">With me</font>

00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
<font color="#f6f6f6">If you're following along</font>

63
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
<font color="#eeeeee">Just like this we can hit run on this code cell</font>

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,496
<font color="#f0f0f0">Get a message to click on this link and enter an authorization code</font>

67
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
<font color="#fcfcfc">File</font>

68
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
<font color="#b6b6b6">Angel Google Drive</font>

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,736
<font color="#fcfcfc">And we can click on this link enter the code</font>

70
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
<font color="#b5b5b5">And that is what allowed was to</font>

71
