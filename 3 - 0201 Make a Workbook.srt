51
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
<font color="#f0f0f0">Let's take a look at how we can make</font>

52
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,800

00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
<font color="#b9b9b9">Ozium AB you can see all that</font>

66
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,736
<font color="#f2f2f2">Now we can set the values of our WS sheet</font>

67
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
<font color="#fcfcfc">What's a sign</font>

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808

73
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,751
<font color="#b9b9b9">Then you'll add a 5in to the quotation marks</font>

74
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
<font color="#ededed">Then after the equal sign you're going to put in some value</font>

75
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,151
<font color="#d5d5d5">Put in some value here</font>

78
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
<font color="#fcfcfc">Let's go ahead and test out the code that we just made</font>

79
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
<font color="#fcfcfc">For example what if I wanted to</font>

80
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
<font color="#ededed">Get the value of wst</font>

81

86
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
<font color="#e6e6e6">We'll look at that we have some value here being printed out</font>

87
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
<font color="#fcfcfc">Because that is the value of</font>

91
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,327
<font color="#f1f1f1">And you just type in WS sheet at</font>
